# Decoherence Learning Journey

Welcome to the Decoherence Learning Journey! This repository will contain a series of Jupyter notebooks designed to guide you through your study of quantum decoherence, starting from basic principles and progressing to more advanced topics. 

The goal is to make it a learning journey which can be used for self study, in the context of quantum mechanics courses or to discover more advanced topics.
